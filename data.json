  "summary_en": "The article provides a mid-term outlook on COVID-19 in China after the pandemic stage, analyzing major influencing factors, regional differences, and the potential evolution of dominant variants. It highlights that NB.1.8.1 and its sub-lineages (including PQ.2) remain dominant, though XFG and other variants are emerging globally. Regional peaks occurred earlier in the northeast and Beijing, later in southern and western regions, with summer floods and humidity causing fluctuations. The overall trend shows a decline, but risks remain from weather, influenza, and mosquito-borne diseases.",
